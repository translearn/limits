# Learning Robot Trajectories subject to Kinematic Joint Constraints

Trajectories with limited jerk, acceleration, velocity and position can be generated by running

    python test_trajectory_generation.py

Several parameters can be adjusted to modify the generated trajectories.
Call

    python test_trajectory_generation.py --help

for further details.

Our code was tested using Ubuntu 16.04. and a virtual python envinronment including the following packages:

    python 3.7.3
    cython 0.29.12
    numpy  1.16.4
    matplotlib 3.1.0

A preprint of the corresponding publication is available at [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00563). \
Further information on the implementation can be found in [docs/background_knowledge.pdf](docs/background_knowledge.pdf).
